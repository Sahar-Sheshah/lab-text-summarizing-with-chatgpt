        "GPT performed strongly when given a clear and well-defined prompt. In the tested review (for a pair of wireless headphones), there was no mention of shipping or delivery, and GPT correctly recognized that, responding appropriately. This demonstrates the model's ability to stay within task boundaries and avoid over-interpreting information.\n",
